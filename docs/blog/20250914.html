          <h3>Here we go</h3>
          <p>
            Yesterday was a busy day, for sure. I learned so much. I learned the new workflows of Drupal core and contrib development. I contributed to DDEV's documentation. I found in issue in Drupal CMS, created a fix, and made my first Gitlab merge request.

            Speaking of DDEV, I'm watching, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUSHF4V7yzs">Contributor Training: Using Claude Code for DDEV Development", from the DDEV team on YouTube.</a>

          <h3>
            Panopoly and Drupal CMS
          </h3>
          <p>
            Years ago, I used to tell people that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/panopoly">Panopoly</a> should be used as an example to build your own site instead of just extending it. Drupal distributions were great but sometimes they caused headaches when you wanted to override their functions. This is how I feel about Drupal CMS. I think I will use it as an example and build my own site separately on Drupal Core for this blog. I'll be taking a look at each of the core and contributed modules that ship with Drupal CMS, taking note of which ones I'll need for the blog.
