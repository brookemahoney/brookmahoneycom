          <h3>Here we go</h3>
          <p>
            Yesterday was a busy day, for sure. I learned so much. I learned the new workflows of Drupal core and contrib development. I contributed to DDEV's documentation. I found in issue in Drupal CMS, created a fix, and made my first Gitlab merge request.

            Speaking of DDEV, I'm watching, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUSHF4V7yzs">Contributor Training: Using Claude Code for DDEV Development", from the DDEV team on YouTube.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>
            Old Distributions remind me of Drupal CMS
          </h3>
          <p>
            Years ago, I used to tell people that Drupal distributions should be used as examples for building sites instead of using them as a starting code base and extending them. Drupal distributions were great but sometimes they caused headaches when you wanted to override their functions. This is how I feel about Drupal CMS, so far. I will use it as an example and I'll build my own site with Drupal Core as a starting point. I'll be taking a look at each of the core and contributed modules that ship with Drupal CMS, taking note of which ones I'll need for the blog.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Modules I'll start with
          </h3>
          <p>
            Pathauto and Redirect should do. I'll disable all the modules that don't make sense for a static site.
