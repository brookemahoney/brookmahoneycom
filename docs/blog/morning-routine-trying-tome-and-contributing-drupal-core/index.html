I check drupal planet, ycombinator, youtube subs, medium digest, email, this, that, and the other. If every day I do this, I know I'm still developing at the cutting edge. When something new comes out, I will always at least see the headlines.</p><p>Yesterday was productive. I learned that Tome is a cool thing for static site generators for Drupal and that it integrates with Gatsby or anything else that can digest JSON. This seems to be a great thing to use. Even if it's buggy, it will be fine, because I can help fix it.</p><p>I like the idea of Tome, which can use Drupal's caching and rendering pipelines. Does the Drupal Gatsby module do anything similar or does it just hook up to GraphQL? What does the module ecosystem look like for Drupal Gatsby versus Tome? Does it makes sense for the two modules to work together so that the Gatsby module provides a generator entity type for Tome?</p><p>I think the first thing I'll do is spin up a default drupal site and then add Tome to it and see what that does.</p><h3>Spinning up a Tome Drupal site locally</h3><p>FirstStart Orbstack. Then, Go to the DDEV docs for the most up to date instructions on creating a new Drupal site: <a href="https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal">https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal</a>. At the time of this writing, this is how it's done:</p><p><code>mkdir tometest &amp;&amp; cd tometest</code><br><code>ddev config --project-type=drupal11 --docroot=web</code><br><code>ddev start</code><br><code>ddev composer create-project "drupal/recommended-project:^11"</code><br><code>ddev composer require drush/drush</code><br><code>ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y</code><br><code>ddev launch</code><br><code># or automatically log in with</code><br><code>ddev launch $(ddev drush uli)</code><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I'll visit <a href="https://tome.fyi/docs/installing-existing-site/">https://tome.fyi/docs/installing-existing-site/</a> and follow the instructions there to install Tome on an existing site.</p><p><code>ddev composer require drupal/tome</code><br><code>ddev drush en tome_static -y</code><br><code>ddev drush tome:static --uri=http://localhost:8001</code><br><code>cd html</code><br><code>python -m http.server 8001</code><br><code>open http://localhost:8001&nbsp;</code></p><p>OMG, are you kidding me? It worked, first time! The Drupal home page is a static page in the /html folder of the install. I mean, this seems amazing.</p><h3>Analyzing what Tome output</h3><p>The first thing I notice is that the contact form is shown. Well, that's not gonna work, now is it? Guess I'll remove that. Let's see how long it takes me... OK, uninstalled the contact module and rebuilt the site in under a minute and a half. Pretty good :)</p><p>rss.xml is there, nice!</p><p>Search page is there... well, that won't work. Let's disable that. The /node path exists, and I don't want that, but the frontpage uses it... I'll keep it for now.</p><p>OK, I think this has progressed far enough for me to use it for my blog. I don't think I'll write about that, but we'll see.</p><h3>Trying Drupal CMS with Tome.</h3><p>Now that I've tried Drupal 11 with Tome and I've started to configure the Drupal site, I'm wondering if using Drupal CMS instead of core Drupal 11 makes more sense. I'm going to give that a go. I might still end up using core and a few contrib modules, but I won't know for sure until I really get my hands dirty with Drupal CMS.</p><h3>The road to Drupal Core contributions.</h3><p>I've tried out Drupal CMS. When I started to dig into what the new core modules are. I see there's an Announcements module but I can't tell what it does. I install the help module and see that the help page for it could use a bit of improvement. This is a perfect time for me to set up my computer for Drupal Core development. After a lot of time searching through various methods, I came across the DDEV concept of "add-ons". There are add-ons for contributing to Drupal core and contrib. Woo hoo.<br><a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev"><cite>https://addons.ddev.com/addons/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev</cite></a><br><a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/ddev/ddev-drupal-contrib"><cite>https://addons.ddev.com/addons/ddev/ddev-drupal-contrib</cite></a></p><h3>OK, the new plan (versus the old way of making a diff and a patch file) to contribute to Drupal core is:</h3><ul><li>Use ddev to create an environment to test changes using <a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev">the ddev core add-on</a></li><li>Once satisfied, make an issue on d.o.</li><li>When the issue is created, a button appears that allows for creating an issue fork.</li><li>Using a separate directory from the one you test locally in, commit your changes to that branch and push back up.</li><li>For testing it on the web, consider using DrupalPod (See <a href="https://www.drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2023/12/using-drupalpod-core-and-contrib-development">https://www.drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2023/12/using-drupalpod-core-and-contrib-development</a>)</li></ul><h3>Drupal contrib</h3><p>When I was looking at modules in Drupal CMS, I noticed Easy Breadcrumb in there. Well, lo and behold, I'm one of the maintainers of that module. Cool! I was reading the help file for it and noticed that a link needed to be updated. So, I made an issue, used the Create Issue Fork button on the issue page, and used the commands there to help me commit my changes and push them back up. When I did that, the terminal gave me a link in Gitlab to create my merge request. I visited the link, filled out the form, and it was done, my first ever merge request for a Drupal contrib project hosted on Gitlab. After that, I went back to the issue, marked it as Needs Review, and unassigned it from myself. As a maintainer, I guess I can go merge the code, but that seems wrong. Hopefully <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/greg-boggs">Greg</a> will see the request and merge it in soon.</p></section></div>
