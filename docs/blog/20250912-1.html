            <h3>Let's do Drupal Gatsby</h3>
            <p>
              Deep breath. OK, I really want this site to be a Drupal Gatsby site. Let's plan it out. I'll read through the docs on the Drupal Gatsby project pages first, to see if there's a recipe available. Then, using Orbstack and DDEV I'll spin up a new drupal instance. I think it makes sense to have the root folder live in a subfolder of the main repo... like how about 'drupal'.
            </p>
            <h3>Let's do Tome</h3>
            <p>
              Found this: "You may use any static site generator in conjunction with Tome by reading exporting JSON directly. See tome-gatsby for an example of a Gatsby integration."
            </p>
            <p>
              "If you want to use Drupal to generate HTML, Tome ships with a static site generator that uses Drupal's internal request handling and concurrency to ensure that pages are exported as quickly as possible."
              <cite><a href="https://tome.fyi/docs/technical/static/">https://tome.fyi/docs/technical/static/</a></cite>
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside: I asked them if they meant "reading exported JSON" instead: https://github.com/drupal-tome/drupal-tome.github.io/issues/35
            </p>
            <p>
              So, If I use Tome, I can use their generator, or Gatsby's, or others. I think it makes sense to Condiser using Tome, especially since the University of Maryland started using it to host 1900 pages, according to a presentation given a few months ago. "At USA.gov, we've reimagined Drupalâ€”not as a single monolith, but as a constellation of microservices, with the Tome module powering our static site generation (SSG) strategy. " Speaker: Jacob Yeager <cite>"Best Drupal is No Drupal Static Site Generation with Tome and Microservices" - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWwOKv8fPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWwOKv8fPg</a></cite>
