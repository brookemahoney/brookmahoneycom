  <title>Running Tests Locally for Drupal Contributed Modules</title>
  <link>https://brookemahoney.com/blog/running-tests-locally-drupal-contributed-modules</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Running Tests Locally for Drupal Contributed Modules&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/easy_breadcrumb"&gt;Easy Breadcrumb&lt;/a&gt; module's &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/easy_breadcrumb?categories=All"&gt;issue queue&lt;/a&gt;. This looks like an interesting one: &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/easy_breadcrumb/issues/3500483"&gt;10.4+: Cache issue (BreadcrumbBuilderInterface::applies() now takes a second $cacheable_metadata argument)&lt;/a&gt; . It involves failing tests. I'll use the &lt;a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/ddev/ddev-drupal-contrib"&gt;ddev addon for drupal contrib&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using that addon, I can easily run tests, like PHPUnit and PHP Code Sniffer (PHPcs). One of the issues that Easy Breadcrumb has is that it's failing PHPcs tests. I want to make changes but ignore all the stuff that was added by .ddev and drupal core when I look at the git diff. So, I add a .gitignore to the root folder with these contents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-plaintext"&gt;.ddev
vendor
web
recipes
.editorconfig
.gitattributes
.gitignore
phpcs.xml.dist
phpstan.neon
phpstan-baseline.neon
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, added a &lt;a href="https://git.drupalcode.org/project/easy_breadcrumb/-/merge_requests/156/diffs"&gt;merge request&lt;/a&gt; for that one. It took awhile to understand what the correct code fix was. It was nice to be able to use VS Code and the Drupal extension to be able to navigate Drupal Core code so intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, added &lt;a href="https://git.drupalcode.org/project/easy_breadcrumb/-/merge_requests/157"&gt;another merge request&lt;/a&gt;, this time for &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/easy_breadcrumb/issues/3501555"&gt;Address PHPCS errors in gitlab-ci jobs&lt;/a&gt;. I really like the new Gitlab workflow for Drupal Contrib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Drupal 11 CKEditor5 Code Highlighting</title>
  <link>https://brookemahoney.com/blog/drupal-11-ckeditor5-code-highlighting</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Drupal 11 CKEditor5 Code Highlighting&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess bash isn't the most common of things to highlight or something because CKEditor5 in Drupal 11 doesn't come with that function. So, now I have to go figure out the best way to do the highlighting. First, I wonder if there is highlighting on any of the code block choices? Let's try some PHP:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-php"&gt;&amp;lt;?php

function hook_ckeditor5_plugin_info_alter(array &amp;amp;$plugin_definitions): void {}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, well, that didn't work (well, it works now, but it didn't when I wrote that). It comes out as plain text. OK, let's see which modules are best for syntax highlighting nowadays. From what I see, CKEditor and highlight.js are a common pair. I'll do that. I'll try out the &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/highlight_js"&gt;Highlight Js syntax highlighter module&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That did it :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span class="field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brooke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Bash scripts for Drupal and Tome&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I got the website all working with &lt;a href="https://drupal.org"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;. I have &lt;a href="https://tome.fyi/"&gt;Tome&lt;/a&gt; successfully exporting the dynamic site to a static site. I'm using some custom bash code to build and preview the static site. It use &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently"&gt;Concurrently&lt;/a&gt; to run two processes in one terminal session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash language-plaintext"&gt;alias brookemahoneycomCd='cd ~/Sites/brookemahoneycom'
brookemahoneycomPreview () {
  brookemahoneycomCd
  cd docs

brookemahoneycomBuild() {
  # Starts Orbstack if it isn't running.
  orb
  # Changes to the drupal directory.
  cd ~/Sites/brookemahoneycom/drupal
  # Exports the site with Tome.
  ddev drush tome:static --uri=https://brookemahoney.com
  # Removes old docs directory.
  rm -rf ~/Sites/brookemahoneycom/docs
  # Copies the Tome build directory to docs for Github hosting.

  # Copies CNAME file for Github hosting.
  cp ~/projects/brookemahoneycom/sync/CNAME ~/Sites/brookemahoneycom/docs/CNAME
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the code for the Drupal install is in &lt;a href="https://github.com/brookemahoney/brookmahoneycom"&gt;this site's Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also added the &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/menu_link_attributes"&gt;Menu Link Attributes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/easy_breadcrumb"&gt;Easy Breadcrumb&lt;/a&gt; modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Evaluating Drupal CMS</title>
  <link>https://brookemahoney.com/blog/evaluating-drupal-cms</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Evaluating Drupal CMS&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;section class="card--inner"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here we go&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a busy day, for sure. I learned so much. I learned the new workflows of Drupal core and contrib development. I contributed to DDEV's documentation. I found in issue in Drupal CMS, created a fix, and made my first Gitlab merge request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of DDEV, I'm watching, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUSHF4V7yzs"&gt;Contributor Training: Using Claude Code for DDEV Development", from the DDEV team on YouTube.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Old Distributions remind me of Drupal CMS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I used to tell people that Drupal distributions should be used as examples for building sites instead of using them as a starting code base and extending them. Drupal distributions were great but sometimes they caused headaches when you wanted to override their functions. This is how I feel about Drupal CMS, so far. I will use it as an example and I'll build my own site with Drupal Core as a starting point. I'll be taking a look at each of the core and contributed modules that ship with Drupal CMS, taking note of which ones I'll need for the blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Modules I'll start with&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathauto and Redirect should do. I'll disable all the modules that don't make sense for a static site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Theming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a theme, I'll use the guide on Drupal.org, &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/theming-drupal/creating-sub-themes"&gt;https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/theming-drupal/creating-sub-themes&lt;/a&gt;, and use the option to generate a theme using drush:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;ddev drush generate theme&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;span class="field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brooke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  <title>Morning routine, Trying Tome, and Contributing to Drupal Core</title>
  <link>https://brookemahoney.com/blog/morning-routine-trying-tome-and-contributing-drupal-core</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Morning routine, Trying Tome, and Contributing to Drupal Core&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;section class="card--inner"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Morning, ya'll&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it's morning, I catch up on reading. I check drupal planet, ycombinator, youtube subs, medium digest, email, this, that, and the other. If every day I do this, I know I'm still developing at the cutting edge. When something new comes out, I will always at least see the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was productive. I learned that Tome is a cool thing for static site generators for Drupal and that it integrates with Gatsby or anything else that can digest JSON. This seems to be a great thing to use. Even if it's buggy, it will be fine, because I can help fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of Tome, which can use Drupal's caching and rendering pipelines. Does the Drupal Gatsby module do anything similar or does it just hook up to GraphQL? What does the module ecosystem look like for Drupal Gatsby versus Tome? Does it makes sense for the two modules to work together so that the Gatsby module provides a generator entity type for Tome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the first thing I'll do is spin up a default drupal site and then add Tome to it and see what that does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spinning up a Tome Drupal site locally&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FirstStart Orbstack. Then, Go to the DDEV docs for the most up to date instructions on creating a new Drupal site: &lt;a href="https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal"&gt;https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of this writing, this is how it's done:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir tometest &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd tometest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev config --project-type=drupal11 --docroot=web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev composer create-project "drupal/recommended-project:^11"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev composer require drush/drush&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev launch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;# or automatically log in with&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev launch $(ddev drush uli)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I'll visit &lt;a href="https://tome.fyi/docs/installing-existing-site/"&gt;https://tome.fyi/docs/installing-existing-site/&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions there to install Tome on an existing site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev composer require drupal/tome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev drush en tome_static -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;ddev drush tome:static --uri=http://localhost:8001&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m http.server 8001&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;open http://localhost:8001&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OMG, are you kidding me? It worked, first time! The Drupal home page is a static page in the /html folder of the install. I mean, this seems amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing what Tome output&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I notice is that the contact form is shown. Well, that's not gonna work, now is it? Guess I'll remove that. Let's see how long it takes me... OK, uninstalled the contact module and rebuilt the site in under a minute and a half. Pretty good :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rss.xml is there, nice!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search page is there... well, that won't work. Let's disable that. The /node path exists, and I don't want that, but the frontpage uses it... I'll keep it for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, I think this has progressed far enough for me to use it for my blog. I don't think I'll write about that, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trying Drupal CMS with Tome.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I've tried Drupal 11 with Tome and I've started to configure the Drupal site, I'm wondering if using Drupal CMS instead of core Drupal 11 makes more sense. I'm going to give that a go. I might still end up using core and a few contrib modules, but I won't know for sure until I really get my hands dirty with Drupal CMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The road to Drupal Core contributions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've tried out Drupal CMS. When I started to dig into what the new core modules are. I see there's an Announcements module but I can't tell what it does. I install the help module and see that the help page for it could use a bit of improvement. This is a perfect time for me to set up my computer for Drupal Core development. After a lot of time searching through various methods, I came across the DDEV concept of "add-ons". There are add-ons for contributing to Drupal core and contrib. Woo hoo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;https://addons.ddev.com/addons/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/ddev/ddev-drupal-contrib"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;https://addons.ddev.com/addons/ddev/ddev-drupal-contrib&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OK, the new plan (versus the old way of making a diff and a patch file) to contribute to Drupal core is:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use ddev to create an environment to test changes using &lt;a href="https://addons.ddev.com/addons/justafish/ddev-drupal-core-dev"&gt;the ddev core add-on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once satisfied, make an issue on d.o.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the issue is created, a button appears that allows for creating an issue fork.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using a separate directory from the one you test locally in, commit your changes to that branch and push back up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For testing it on the web, consider using DrupalPod (See &lt;a href="https://www.drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2023/12/using-drupalpod-core-and-contrib-development"&gt;https://www.drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2023/12/using-drupalpod-core-and-contrib-development&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drupal contrib&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was looking at modules in Drupal CMS, I noticed Easy Breadcrumb in there. Well, lo and behold, I'm one of the maintainers of that module. Cool! I was reading the help file for it and noticed that a link needed to be updated. So, I made an issue, used the Create Issue Fork button on the issue page, and used the commands there to help me commit my changes and push them back up. When I did that, the terminal gave me a link in Gitlab to create my merge request. I visited the link, filled out the form, and it was done, my first ever merge request for a Drupal contrib project hosted on Gitlab. After that, I went back to the issue, marked it as Needs Review, and unassigned it from myself. As a maintainer, I guess I can go merge the code, but that seems wrong. Hopefully &lt;a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/greg-boggs"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt; will see the request and merge it in soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Drupal Tome and Gatsby</title>
  <link>https://brookemahoney.com/blog/drupal-tome-and-gatsby</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Drupal Tome and Gatsby&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;section class="card--inner"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let's do Drupal Gatsby&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep breath. OK, I really want this site to be a Drupal Gatsby site. Let's plan it out. I'll read through the docs on the Drupal Gatsby project pages first, to see if there's a recipe available. Then, using Orbstack and DDEV I'll spin up a new drupal instance. I think it makes sense to have the root folder live in a subfolder of the main repo... like how about 'drupal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let's do Tome&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Found this: "You may use any static site generator in conjunction with Tome by reading exporting JSON directly. See tome-gatsby for an example of a Gatsby integration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to use Drupal to generate HTML, Tome ships with a static site generator that uses Drupal's internal request handling and concurrency to ensure that pages are exported as quickly as possible." &lt;a href="https://tome.fyi/docs/technical/static/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;https://tome.fyi/docs/technical/static/&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside: I asked them if they meant "reading exported JSON" instead: https://github.com/drupal-tome/drupal-tome.github.io/issues/35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, If I use Tome, I can use their generator, or Gatsby's, or others. I think it makes sense to Condiser using Tome, especially since the University of Maryland started using it to host 1900 pages, according to a presentation given a few months ago. "At USA.gov, we've reimagined Drupal—not as a single monolith, but as a constellation of microservices, with the Tome module powering our static site generation (SSG) strategy. " Speaker: Jacob Yeager &lt;cite&gt;"Best Drupal is No Drupal Static Site Generation with Tome and Microservices" - &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWwOKv8fPg"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWwOKv8fPg&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden"&gt;Random Things, Catching Up, and AI&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Random Things, Catching Up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things. Stuff. Blog. React. Drupal. Gatsby. Tome. React-Router. Remix. Epic Stack. Drupal Stack. Fly.io. Typescript. Rusty dev chops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Took a couple of years off. Now, I'm rusty; getting back into things. Been watching lots of recent Drupal presentations lately, mostly from DrupalCon and from GovCon. Also learned about the Epic Stack, which is what Kent Dodds has been working on. I've spent a lot of hours relearning Typescript and React.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have I been gone? Life got in the way, as an old manager of mine used to say. The last big company I worked for was a very successful startup, then Covid hit, and it was a wild ride after that. It became so wild that it wasn't a good fit for me anymore. I was with them for about 5 years, so it was sad to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first blog post here on my brand new super fancy site is a bit of a dump. It's ok. I have a headache today. It just reminded me of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm really looking forward to working full time again. I just need to find a good company that could use someone who likes working with Drupal and/or React. In the meantime, I'm going to spend my days working on learning what best practices have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted on Github pages, which is kinda cool. They host the code too. So, I just am paying for a domain and email and hosting is done for free. I just have to keep the source code for the site public, which is fine. Open source it all, ok. I was using Vite with a simple React Router implementation. For now, I'm using vanilla HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I suppose I'll migrate this site over to Drupal with Gatsby. I'll develop the Drupal site and back it up locally with Apple's Time Machine. I'll use Gatsby to export my Drupal site to a static site. This method should work good for my home site with its simplistic blog that I want to keep this year and it will be a good way to showcase some of my Drupal and React skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aye, aye, AI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, AI. Forgot to talk about that. OMG, everyone is talking about it and apparently a lot people really like using it for web development. I've heard it described as a junior developer with no memory. To me, it's just not that helpful. I like to read manuals and understand every bit of code I write. I'm not one of those programmers who likes to move fast and make lots of mistakes. I like careful planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that's enough writing for now. It's been nice talking about this stuff with you. Maybe I'll try it again later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
